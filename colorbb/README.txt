This is the colorbb script from Mateusz Loskot. It certainly works well on Ubuntu.

To use it for building Fost run the use_colorbb script. This will replace the installed version of bjam and will give you some output colouring. You will need to run use_colorbb again if you change Boost versions, i.e. every time the Boost/install script is run.
